# Analyze-gpt

This is a project that demonstrates how to use AI technologies to create an application that can analyze texts, podcasts, interviews, and other content with Deepgram and chatGPT.

This project was built in Vue.js on the front-end and Node.js on the backend.

## Get It Working

To see this project working, you can clone the project and then do the following.

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Create .env file

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and then go into the `.gitignore` file and add `.env` to the list. This will make sure that the `.env` file does not get pushed up to github if you choose to push the project up to github.

## API Keys

Add API keys to the `.env` file as you see in the `.env-example` file. Go to each of these websites to sign up for an API key:
